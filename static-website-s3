Creating a static website using Amazon S3

Login to console and go to S3.
Create a new bucket
  Must ba a universal name
We want this bucket to be public
  Uncheck all private bucket boxes
Keep all other selections default.
Upload both html files. (index and error pages)
We now have to enable static website hosting for the bucket.
In properties enable Static website hosting
Website endpoint URL should be available
If you click on this you should get an error code. 
Tthe bucket to be public, but contents like our html pages are not.
Creating a bucket policy should fix this issue.
In the Permissions tab click edit in the Bucket Policy section.
The following is a policy example that can be used.

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": ""arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET-NAME>/*""
        }
    ]
}

Save changes
You can reload html page and confirm that it's working.
